<!-- ### Build, Run, Test
 #### Simple Run
The service can be built and run in one command from the project directory
`> go run ./cmd/petserver`

This starts a server listening on port 4852. The port can be configured using the `-p <port>` flag.
`> go run ./cmd/petserver -p 9412`

#### Build to binary and run
To build a binary, from the project directory, execute the command
`> go build -o build/petserver ./cmd/petserver`

Run the server using
`> ./build/petserver -p 9412`

#### Test
To run unit tests, use the command
`> go test ./...`

The same command can be used to generate a code coverage report using some options
`> go test ` -->
